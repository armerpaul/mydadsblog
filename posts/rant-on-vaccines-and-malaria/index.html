So as my wife reminds me… it is not all about Lee.  Apparently, mRNA therapeutic backdates to the 80’s.  A new off shoot of this work is a highly effective vaccine against malaria.   If you are bored and technical here is a paper on the study <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3830681">https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3830681</a></p>
<p>For those of you that have better things to do with your eyes than to review technical papers, here is a summary:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This new vaccine (R21) uses a circumsporozoite protein (CSP) antigen. It also uses the exact same adjuvant from Novavax (Matrix-M – a recombinant nanoparticle vaccine) that Novavax is using in their coronavirus vaccine – you can’t keep a good adjuvant down.  The studies were done on infants (5 to 17 months old) with great results (77% efficacy).  They had good studies on this age group already.  They plan phase III studies in different regions of Africa and on varying age groups.  Novavax has its resources re-directed to the Corona vaccine recently, but as resources can be directed back to malaria, they have the production capacity to produce enough vaccine to perform the Phase III studies.  Overall, this is definitely the best malaria vaccine candidate the world has yet seen, and that is unequivocal good news.  Watch Novavax stock.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2019, malaria caused an estimated 229 million clinical episodes, and 409,000 deaths. An estimated 94% of those deaths in 2019 were in the African Region.  For those of you that heard from Qanon that Bill Gates was putting microchips in the Corona-19 vaccine, since the Gates foundation is big on malaria, I expect to hear that there is some nefarious Gates involvement in this new malaria vaccine.  Like the claim that the current administration is seeking to ban beef, I expect this new Qanon claim to have no involvement in fact.  Hold on for this one.</p>
