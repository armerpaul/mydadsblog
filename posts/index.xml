      <description>Remember M.C.Escher?
Back in the 70’s I worked on an advanced project to design a new computer language, and then write a compiler to translate that new language into machine code but using that new language itself to do the work. A compiler is a program which converts English language looking instructions into machine code which is a series of ones and zeros that the machine actually executes. We used that famous drawing of M.</description>

      <description>You have heard about CRISPR, I suspect. It is a gene-editing technology which can modify, delete or correct (modify) precise regions of DNA or RNA. If you want a treatise on the interaction of DNA and RNA, let me know. But in a drastic simplification: a DNA strand reproduces itself by breaking in specific places, uses RNA to make a copy of the DNA strands, and then reconnects the duplicated pieces to form a duplicate of the original.</description>
