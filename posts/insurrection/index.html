    </header><p>14th amendment in part:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have <strong>engaged in insurrection</strong> or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice it does not say convicted but just “engaged in”.</p>
<p>The current impeachment for Trump has one article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ARTICLE 1: INCITEMENT OF INSURRECTION</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the house passes the impeachment bill, and the senate agrees, then the senate need not have a separate vote to exclude Trump from future office.  I could argue that House passage alone is sufficient indication that Trump <strong>engaged in insurrection</strong>.</p>
<p>Current news articles are saying that Trump is admitting that he bears some responsibility for the Capital Riot.  If there is some official finding, like a conviction of one of the persons, and that conviction includes “insurrection”, then I suspect Trump is excluded from future office, bylaw and his admission, if not by reason alone.</p>
