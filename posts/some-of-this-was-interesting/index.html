<p>Ipsos Group is a multinational market research and consulting firm with headquarters in Paris, France.  IPSOS used a survey of 1040 in this case.  For the mathematicians among you, a sample size of 1068 gives you a 95% confidence with a 3% margin of error.  To get a more accurate 2% margin you would need to more than double the sample size.  That is why you see surveys of around 1000 people.</p>
