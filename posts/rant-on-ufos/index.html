    </header><p>Let&rsquo;s do a little math. A planet 10,000 light years away (really close by astronomical scales) decides to send a ship at 99% the speed of light to intercept earth. By the way, no transmission FROM earth was emitted 10,000 years in our past, so it would be curious as to why earth would be interesting, but I digress. Somehow the planet has some ability to accelerate a ship at 99% the speed of light. Just from the energy standpoint it would take all the energy consumed on earth in the period of 2 years to get to 99% the speed of light. Even if we disregard the fact that we do not have the technology to go 99%, it still takes that amount of energy. So, you can see that is an expensive project. But wait, it takes an equivalent amount of energy to slow down. Hmmm 4 years of a planet&rsquo;s energy (“wait honey, the lights will be back on in 4 years”). Even if you did not store energy to return to your home planet, you need to have the ability to store 2 years of energy to slow down when you approached earth. But again I digress. The trip at 99% the speed of light takes over 20000 years so to get here now, they needed to start their trip 20000 years ago. I am not sure if one would assume a life form would be making the 20000 year trip to earth or robots, but it would take them another 20000 years to return to their home planet. After the 20000 year trip to earth, would they just zip around, and not make contact?</p>
<p>Well, the show &ldquo;60 minutes&rdquo; wants you to believe the UFO&rsquo;s are not mundane sightings. Feel free to review the attached PDF which I modified from SKEPTIC.COM[1]</p>
