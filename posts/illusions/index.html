Back in the 70’s I worked on an advanced project to design a new computer language, and then write a compiler to translate that new language into machine code but using that new language itself to do the work. A compiler is a program which converts English language looking instructions into machine code which is a series of ones and zeros that the machine actually executes. We used that famous drawing of M.">

<p>Back in the 70’s I worked on an advanced project to design a new computer language, and then write a compiler to translate that new language into machine code but using that new language itself to do the work.  A compiler is a program which converts English language looking instructions into machine code which is a series of ones and zeros that the machine actually executes.  We used that famous drawing of M.C.Escher which had the two hands drawing each other, as a logo for the project.</p>
<p>I saw a video where a guy explained how to make reality from the illusion.  I removed the audio and clipped the interesting parts of the video.  Enjoy.</p>
