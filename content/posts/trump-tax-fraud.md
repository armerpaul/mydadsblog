My limited thoughts:

Trump, and or his company may have committed fraud against banks and insurance companies, and in the process state and federal tax fraud.

New York state is actively investigating those parties.

There may have been events involving tax/accounting fraud with regard to the CFO and his family with regard to bills paid or not charged and benefits given to executives and relatives of executives of the CFO and Trump and his relatives.  There may have been personal expenses (payments to women) that were characterized as tax deductible “Legal” expenses and recorded on Trump Organization financial records.

The state of New your is apparently pressuring the CFO (Allen Weissenberg) to testify against Trump.  That pressure is apparently in the form of “not prosecuting” the CFO and his family.

However, if state tax fraud occurred (the source of the pressure) then the State of New York cannot grant immunity for Federal tax fraud. That makes it difficult for Weissenberg to flip on Trump.
