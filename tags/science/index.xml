      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s do a little math. A planet 10,000 light years away (really close by astronomical scales) decides to send a ship at 99% the speed of light to intercept earth. By the way, no transmission FROM earth was emitted 10,000 years in our past, so it would be curious as to why earth would be interesting, but I digress. Somehow the planet has some ability to accelerate a ship at 99% the speed of light.</description>

      <description>You have heard about CRISPR, I suspect. It is a gene-editing technology which can modify, delete or correct (modify) precise regions of DNA or RNA. If you want a treatise on the interaction of DNA and RNA, let me know. But in a drastic simplification: a DNA strand reproduces itself by breaking in specific places, uses RNA to make a copy of the DNA strands, and then reconnects the duplicated pieces to form a duplicate of the original.</description>
