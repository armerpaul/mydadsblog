      <description>My limited thoughts:
Trump, and or his company may have committed fraud against banks and insurance companies, and in the process state and federal tax fraud.
New York state is actively investigating those parties.
There may have been events involving tax/accounting fraud with regard to the CFO and his family with regard to bills paid or not charged and benefits given to executives and relatives of executives of the CFO and Trump and his relatives.</description>
